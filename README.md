# Surfs Up

## Overview of the Analysis

W. Avy is considering investing in a surf and ice cream shop. This analysis is on Oahu temperatures in June and December to determine if business would be sustainable year-round. Avy will use the information from this analysis to help determine if he will make the investment.

## Results

The results of the Oahu temperature study take 1700 June temperature points into consideration over 8 years and 1517 December temperature points into consideration over 7 years and compares the statistics. 

- The range of temperatures in June is 21 degrees with a minimum of 64 F and a maximum of 85 F. December was a slightly larger range of 27 degrees with a minimum of 56 F and a maximum of 83 F. 

- June had a mean of 74.94 F and December had a mean of 71.04 F.

- In this data set June has 1 more year of data (2017) than December. It would be a more accurate comparison to remove the 2017 dataset for June. 

## Summary

In Oahu the yearly temperature fluctuations are very small based on the dataset. Between June and December there is only an 8 F difference for the minimum and a 2 F difference on the maxiumum. The average temperature is also only 4 F different. In conclusion in Oahu the demand for surfing and ice cream should have little impact due to temperature since the temperature fluctuatons are very small.

Two additional queries that would provide additional data to help decision making would be studying precipitation and factors affecting wave quality throughout the year in Oahu. I believe these two factors will also affect the business at the surf and ice cream shop.
